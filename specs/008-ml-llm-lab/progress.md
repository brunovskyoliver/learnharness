# Progress: 008 ML and LLM learning lab

## Stage

Specified, clarified, designed, planned, tasked and analyzed on 2026-10-28. **Not implemented.** Implementation is handed off: see [handoff.md](handoff.md).

## Decisions

- **Oliver's answers** (12, spec Clarifications):
  - both routes (inline tool + demo builder);
  - illustrative numbers labelled "Illustrative numbers";
  - tokenizers o200k, cl100k and GPT-2, with the `js-tiktoken` dependency approved;
  - Hugging Face anonymous only;
  - automatic paper reading capped at 10 pages per turn;
  - lookups for teacher and researcher;
  - editable token text;
  - toggle names "ML visuals", "Model hub" and "Papers";
  - size and call limits;
  - row copy "Source · what";
  - the 4 analyze fixes, applied.
- **Agent decisions** (technical, within the spec; research.md R2–R6):
  - panels as kit types with expression data;
  - tokens filled server-side;
  - `ml_visual` follows the `plot` pattern;
  - a tokenize bridge plus an API route;
  - `config.json` over HTTPS beside the HF MCP server;
  - papers over plain HTTPS (Semantic Scholar → arXiv);
  - per-instance counters.
- **Drafts awaiting Oliver's approval in the PR**: tool descriptions (contracts/ml-visual-tool.md, lookups.md), doctrine (contracts/doctrine.md), and the running-row labels, the "Tokenized · …" row and "Editing works in the app" (ui-contract.md, tasks T012 and T021).
- **Open question for Oliver**: does the 10-page cap also cover the researcher's existing `web_fetch_pdf` and `pdf_*` tools? Until he answers, it covers only the new `paper_read`, and the existing tools are unchanged.

## Log

- Spec, then 5 clarify questions. Checklist 16/16.
- Design canvas: https://claude.ai/artifact/EmWdcYcnZrXu5Ng1VyHiA6 (9 boards; panel boards are interactive).
- Network probes from this environment were blocked (403) for huggingface.co, arxiv.org and semanticscholar.org. Hence task T002.
- js-tiktoken 1.0.21 was measured locally (research R1).
- speckit-analyze: 0 critical, 1 high (the drafts; resolved by the PR review), 4 medium fixed.

## Report

Pending implementation.
